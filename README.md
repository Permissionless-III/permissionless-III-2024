- Project name: Decentralized Voting
- Project short bio: The project is a decentralized voting system that allows users to vote on a variety of topics. This application allows users to egistration, create and view elections, vote in elections, and view election results. 
- Project long description: This decentralized application is built using Next.js, Wagmi, and Solidity. Elections are created initially by the owner of the contract, add candidates to the election, and set the start and end times. The web application starts by having the user connect their wallet to the application. Once connected they will they be required to register to vote by by utilizing the Sumsub platform to confirm who they are. The user will do so by using Sumsub's ID-document verification. After the registration process is complete they will be able to view the total list of elections and select which one they would like to participant in. By clicking on a specific election the user will then see a vote submissions page where they can select which candidate they would like to vote for. They will select who they want to vote for then sign a transaction with their wallet to submit their vote. Once the transaction is confirmed the user will be redirected to the results page where they can view the total results of the election. Future work would include cleaning up the look of the web application, allow the web application users to be able to create their own elections and manage them, creating permission specific voting elections, and setting up a governance system for the contract, and allowing the contract to be able to host multiple types of elections.
