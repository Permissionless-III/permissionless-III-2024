- Project name: BitVote
- Project short bio: The BitVote project is a decentralized voting application. In this software you will be able to view current elections taking place, create an election, vote on an election, and view election results.
- Project long description: This decentralized application is built using Next.js, Wagmi, and Solidity. Upon starting the application the user must register themselves and their wallet. In order to register the user must connect their wallet to the application. Once connected, the Sumsub integration triggers and the user will need to sign a transaction to register their wallet with the application. After the registration process is complete they will be redirected to the home page. On the home page the user will be able to view current elections. From there, they will then be able to click on a specific election and view the candidates in that election. If the election is currently active the user will be able to vote for their chosen candidate. Once the election is complete the user will be able to view the results.
