- Project name: BitVote
- Project short bio: The BitVote app is an onchain voting application on Rootstock. Users can view current elections, cast their vote, and verify that their vote was recorded correctly onchain. There is also an admin UI for creating elections and assign candidations.
- Project long description: To register as a new voter, users must connect their wallet and complete Sumsub verification, which includes identity document upload and liveness check. They also must sign a transaction to register with the application. After the registration process is complete, they can view elections. If an election is currently active and the user has not previously voted, the user will be able to vote for their chosen candidate. After voting, they see the results and a block explorer link that shows their vote. Once the election is complete, the user will be able to view the results. This app was build using Next.js, Wagmi, Solidity, and Sumsub.

We were unable to completely setup an Election on Rootstock due to issues with contract verification via the explorer and Hardhat. Thus, we used Sepolia as a backup for demonstration purposes.
